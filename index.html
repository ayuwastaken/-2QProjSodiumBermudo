                <div class="gamedesc">In the midst of the woods, the heart of the forest lies untouched. The rustle of the trees, footsteps trudging through the collection of rock and mud, plants and algae growing from all places. The Sakura Shrine stands tall, domineering and powerful, while the Moderna flourish in creative technology. This world that houses Eldritch Enigmas; what secrets is it housing? For beneath the name of this Enigma will we learn the more; their voices grow louder for every second one is stasis</div>

                    <span class="reviewtext">Very unique gameplay, and the world immersion is amazing! The NPCs feel alive and with depth; paired with the visuals- just phenominal. And the lore is so complicatedly riveting that you cant help but want more, to <em>know</em> more. I can see why this game is so popular, and it definitely deserves all the attention it gets <3</span>

<!--all other media used is made by me; the story unfolds itself by time and 
i plan on using my scuffed designs and progress making this website to be
part of the overarching story of this arg in a way. all the files in here are
meant to be explored, so images or css classes/ids that look off or have 
ominous and vague names are on purpose; to fuel the storyline in the long run-->
